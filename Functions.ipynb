A return statement is overall used to invoke a function so that the passed statements can be executed.\n",

    "Ans. Distinguishing between iterators and iterables\n",
    "1. The __iter__() method is not associated with the iterator or the iterables. It shows different behavior for both. In the case of iterators, it returns self and must implement the __next__() method whereas, in the case of iterables, it returns the iterator object that returns elements when called.\n",

    "## Q8> What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "Ans. Lambda Function, also referred to as ‘Anonymous function’ is same as a regular python function but can be defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword. However,they are restricted to single line of expression. They can take in mutliple parameters as in regular functions.\n",
    "### NEED FOR LAMBDA FUNCTIONS-\n",
    "There are at least 3 reasons:\n",
    "1. Lambda functions reduce the number of lines of code when compared to normal python function defined using def keyword. But this is not exactly true because, even functions defined with def can be defined in one single line. But generally, def functions are written in more than 1 line.\n",
    "2. They are generally used when a function is needed temporarily for a short period of time, often to be used inside another function such as filter, map and reduce.\n",
    "3. Using lambda function, you can define a function and call it immediately at the end of definition. This can’t be done with def functions.\n"
